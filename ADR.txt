1. Modules that must be implemented as android module should be split between api and implementation modules

- context
-- how to split modules? Which modules should be split between api and implementation?

- considered solutions
-- just implementation modules, public interface and everything else marked as internal
-- clean kotlin/java module with api and implementation android module

- decision
-- create clean kotlin api module and android implementation modules every time the implementation modules is an android module

- consequences
-- downside - more modules for little gain in initial stages of the project
-- upside - easier to change implementation in the future. Allows to have domain modules as clean kotlin/java module instead of forcing whole stack to be android modules
